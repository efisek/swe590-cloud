# SWE590 Cloud Computing Term Project

In this project, we aimed to compare the performance of an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance with that of an Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster, under different load conditions. To do this, we set up a test environment consisting of EC2 instances and an ECS cluster, both running the same application, and used a load generator tool (JMeter) to send GET requests to both environments. We measured the CPU utilization and response time for each environment and analyzed the results to determine the performance of each.
